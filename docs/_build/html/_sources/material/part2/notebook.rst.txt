Dual Numbers Class
==========================================

This section covers the implementation and methods of the `Dual` class, which is used to handle dual numbers and perform automatic differentiation.

The functions defined in this section, allow us to adapt different operators and fucntions to dual numbers.

These redefinitions are very important as these functions and operators are at the heart of the automatic differentiation process.
