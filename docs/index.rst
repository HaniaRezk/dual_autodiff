This is the documentation page for the dual_autodiff package. 

Overview
----------------------------------------

Dual numbers, represented as x = a+bε, are numbers that consist of a real part a, and a dual part b carried by ε that satisfies ε2 = 0.

They can be used to compute derivatives efficiently; this approach, called forward-mode automatic differentiation, is particularly valuable in fields like machine learning as it enables fast training of deep neural networks.

This project aims to create a package that performs automatic differentiation using these dual numbers.

Getting Started
----------------------------------------

To install the package refer to the README file at the root of the project repository
